Chess Program Overview

Module Imports:

Various chess pieces (Rook, Pawn, King, Bishop, Queen, Knight) are imported from a module named chestPieces.
Standard Python libraries (sys, os, pickle, re) are also imported for various functionalities.
ChessBoard Class:

Represents the game state and operations on the chessboard.
Attributes:

board: A 2D list representing the chessboard, initialized with standard chess pieces at their respective starting positions.
Methods:

__init__(self): Initializes the game board to the standard starting position.
display(self): Outputs the current state of the chessboard to the console.
validateInput(self, move): Validates a player's move input to ensure it adheres to the required format (e.g., 'A1-A2').
run(self): Main game loop where players are prompted to make moves, save, or quit. It also handles player turns.
handleMove(self, move): Processes a player's move, parsing input and updating the board state.
isValidMove(self, src_cord, dest_cord): Checks if a move from a source coordinate to a destination coordinate is valid according to the rules of chess (currently a placeholder).
convert_to_coord(self, notation): Converts user-friendly board notation (e.g., 'E2') into board coordinates (e.g., (1, 4)).
quit(self): Exits the game and clears the console.
save(self): Attempts to save the current game state to a file for later continuation using the pickle library.
load(cls): Class method that attempts to load a previously saved game state from a file.
reset(self): Resets the game to its initial state and restarts the game loop.
Main Execution:

When the script is run directly, it displays a welcome message.
It prompts the player to load a previously saved game or start a new one.
Depending on the player's choice, it either loads a game or initializes a new board and enters the game loop.

High-Level TODOs for Chess Program Completion

Piece Movement:

Implement the individual movement rules for each chess piece in their respective classes or within the isValidMove method.
Ensure captures, pawn promotions, and special moves like castling and en passant are handled.
Check and Checkmate Detection:

Implement a function to determine if a king is in check.
Extend this to detect checkmate situations.
Stalemate and Draw Scenarios:

Handle stalemate scenarios (when a player has no legal moves left and their king is not in check).
Implement the fifty-move rule and threefold repetition for draw conditions.
Enhanced User Interface:

Perhaps consider improving the display, making it more visually appealing or even migrating to a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like pygame or tkinter.
Error Handling:

Robustly handle potential errors: incorrect move formats, moves that place one's own king in check, etc.
Provide user feedback for these errors to guide the player.
Enhanced Saving/Loading Mechanism:

Enhance the save/load functionality to include meta-data like player names, game duration, etc.
Implement an auto-save feature after every move.
Player Profiles:

Allow players to create profiles with statistics (e.g., games won, lost, drawn).
Optionally, implement a rating system for players.
Game History and Move Undo:

Implement a move history system, allowing players to review past moves.
Optionally, allow players to undo moves or even replay a game from a particular move.
AI Opponent:

Develop a simple AI opponent for single-player mode using basic algorithms or more advanced methods like the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
Testing and Refactoring:

Continually test each implemented feature to ensure correct functionality.
As the codebase grows, consider refactoring for clarity, maintainability, and efficiency.
Ensure saved game compatibility across different versions of the game.
Documentation and Tutorials:
Create comprehensive documentation for your code.
Develop user-friendly tutorials or guides for first-time players.
Expansion and Features:
Consider implementing variants of chess (like speed chess, or thematic chess variants).
Add sounds, music, or other multimedia enhancements for a richer experience.
Optimization:
As your game grows, monitor performance and make necessary optimizations.
Consider using profiling tools to pinpoint any bottlenecks in the code.
Release and Distribution:
Once you're satisfied with the game's stability and feature set, package it for release.
Consider distribution methods, be it as a downloadable executable, a web-based game, or even as a mobile app.
